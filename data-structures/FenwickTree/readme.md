Binary Indexed Tree also called Fenwick Tree provides a way to represent an array of numbers in an array, allowing prefix sums to be calculated efficiently. It can be used efficiently instead of using space consuming segment tree for range sum queries.

Space Complexity: O(N) for declaring another array of N=size num_of_elements
Time Complexity: O(logN) for each operation(update and query as well)
